                <h2>I’ve been receiving death threats for restricting Mohbad’s DM – Oxlade</h2>
                <p>Sensational Nigerian singer, Ikuforiji Olaitan Abdulrahman, popularly known as Oxlade, has explained why he restricted late rapper, Mohbad’s messages on Instagram.

                    Recall that Oxlade recently came under fire after he shared a screenshot of his chat with the late rapper whilst paying tribute to him which showed that he restricted Mohbad’s DM.
                    
                    Reacting via a statement shared on his X handle on Friday, Oxlade explained that he didn’t restrict Mohbad’s DM out of pride as speculated.
                    
                    
                    He said he restricted the DMs of important people and friends to show his management who handles his social media accounts that the restricted account are personal to him.
                    
                    He said he has been receiving death threats since the speculations gained prominence.
                    
                    Oxlade said, “How do you think people like me manage the DMs? We have teams. I restrict certain accounts to only me/my phone so only I can reply.
                    
                    “I’m not clearing my name. I am giving you facts.
                    
                    “I’ve lost a friend and I can’t even grieve properly because elders and blogs want to use me for clickbait. Fighting against bullying but you are bullying me. Make it make sense.
                    
                    “I only restrict accounts I have a personal relationship with because my label runs my account in order not to miss important bookings and business conversations. So the restricted account is a way of pointing out to my label that the messages from these accounts are private and they come from my close friends.
                    
                    “I have been getting death threats ever since the event was unveiled but I no take anything personal because everything happens for a reason. You can silence me with a scandal but you can never dim my light. Imole season for a reason. Love; Gaza.”

                <p>Promise Aloba, Mohbad’s mother, has called on the Nigerian Senate to ensure Naira Marley is arrested.

                    Mrs Aloba called for the singer’s arrest when the Chairman, Senate Committee on Entertainment Economy, Elisha Abbo, and Nollywood actresses Tonto Dikeh and Iyabo Ojo, paid the family a condolence visit in Lagos on Thursday.
                    
                    “I know my son; he told me that Naira Marley usually threatened him. Please, Nigerians, help me to look for him; please have mercy on me; that is all you can do for me.
                    
                    
                    “I cannot singlehandedly fish him out. Also, he told me the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) gave him some water in a bottle to drink sometimes ago. Help me please.
                    
                    “My son was always beaten. Even he was mentioning Sam Larry, l don’t know them. They enslaved my son.
                    
                    “He was always telling me to guide him so he would not be killed, these were all he was saying until they finally killed him. Please help me.”</p>

                    <h2>Mohbad was afraid I would be kidnapped- Singer’s Mother narrates son’s ordeals</h2>
                    <p>Mrs Promise Aloba, the mother of the late Nigerian singer, Ilerioluwa Aloba, popularly known as Mohbad, has disclosed that the deceased was afraid that she would be kidnapped.

                        She disclosed that the fear of her being kidnapped led to her refusal to reside in the Ikorodu area of Lagos State where Mohbad rented an apartment and wanted to set up a business for her.
                        
                        Narrating her last moment with Mohbad, Mrs Aloba disclosed how the deceased and his wife deceived her to stay with them due to the trauma he was passing through.
            
                        overlay-clevercloseLogo
                        Mohbad died about two weeks ago, and controversy has surrounded his death.
                        
                        The controversy surrounding Mohbad’s death led to the exhumation of his corpse by the relevant authorities.
                        
                        But, addressing some journalists in the singer’s house, Mrs Aloba said: “I don’t tell people that I’m Mohbad’s mother because he was afraid I will be kidnapped.
                        
                        “He took me away from Iyana to Ikorodu and promised to set up a business for me. However, I can’t stay in Ikorodu again; I asked that they should rent out the shop because I’m afraid.
                        
                        “My child never enjoyed himself; he was always afraid whenever I came to visit; he found it difficult to sleep as he would be breathing heavily. They usually go to the police station to report.
                        
                        “I spent 10 days in his house without knowing he would die, I just left here on Saturday, not knowing he would die on Monday. He was begging me not to leave, but he allowed me when I told him to go to church. He and his wife were deceiving me not to leave. He has not given me my feeding allowance because he never wanted me to leave.”</p>

                    <h2>I was criticized for speaking up against Naira Marley – Lagos Police ex-PRO, Badmus Opetodolapo</h2>
                    <p>Following the circumstances surrounding singer Mohbad’s death, the former Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Badmus Opetodolapo, has recounted the heavy criticisms she received after speaking up against Nigerian musician, Naira Marley.

                        Recall that the police officer, who was known for her active presence on social media, had in 2019 on her page condemned Naira Marley’s lifestyle and his post concerning women’s bodies.
                        
                        In 2019, Naira Marley had in a tweet said “Having a big booty is better than having a master’s degree.”
                        
                        overlay-clevercloseLogo
                        In response, the then Lagos Police PRO wrote: “So having a big body part is now better than having Educational or vocational qualifications? I still can’t get over this! we need to restore sanity to our system and stop tolerating public nuisance. Its mediocracy for anyone to applaud an obviously delinquent and unproductive dead duck hiding under the guise of making music, obnoxious music for that matter.
                        
                        “My advice to younger ones: let no one confuse you that having a good body part is great but to have educational or vocational qualifications is more important! In fact it’s non-negotiable! Your body part cannot give you sustainable existence only good educational or vocational qualifications will do. Be guided! #saynotoharddrugs #harddrugdestroys.”
                        
                        Firing back at her, Naira Marley, the owner of Marlian Music that formerly signed Mohbad, wrote: “This instagram police want to have sex with me but she is really ugly.”
                        
                        DAILY POST reports that Mohbad, who had sometime called out Naira Marley for threat to life, died on Tuesday in a controversial manner.
                        
                        After Mohbad’s death, Naira Marley and his associate, Sam Larry came under heavy fire after a series of documents and videos of the duo subjecting the late singer to relentless bully for leaving Marlians Record surfaced on the internet.
                        
                        Reacting to the controversies on her official Instagram page, the former Lagos PRO, Opetodolapo disclosed that when she spoke up against Naira Marley in 2019, she was criticized.
                        
                        “So many tags on me, I plead I’m left out of tagging, relevant authorities are on this matter.
                        
                        “When I singlehandedly spoke up against this character and imminent danger it portrays, I was bashed both inside and out, a danger not curtailed will become hydraheaded, my heart is with the departed and everything that represents him,” she wrote.

                    <h2>Lagos socialite, Sam Larry breaks silence over alleged involvement in Mohbad’s death</h2>
                    <p>Lagos socialite and show promoter, Samson Erinfolabi Balogun, popularly known as Sam Larry, who was accused of having a hand in the death of singer Mohbad, has finally broken his silence.

                        DAILY POST reports that the 27-year-old singer died on Tuesday in a controversial manner.
                        
                        Sam Larry, an associate of the owner of Marlian Music that formerly signed Mohbad, Naira Marley, came under heavy fire on the internet after a video of him and his men disrupting Mohbad’s video shoot with Zlatan Ibile surfaced on social media.
                        
                        
                        It was also alleged that the music promoter and his associates subjected Mohbad to relentless bullying and influenced promoters to deprive him of opportunities, making his life increasingly challenging after leaving Marlian Record.
                        
                        The late singer had, three months ago, petitioned the Nigeria Police, alleging his life was being threatened by Sam Larry and Naira Marley.
                        
                        Addressing the allegations in a trending video on social media, Larry denied having a hand in Mohbad’s death, describing him as his beloved brother.
                        
                        “Mohbad is my brother. When he was signed to Marlian Records, he knew I loved him so much. Even his wife and everyone else know that I love Mohbad.
                        
                        “Everywhere I go, whether it is Kenya or Dubai, I will call him so that we can go together. I will pay Marlian Records for a show, and we will go together.
                        
                        “The videos going viral happened last year when I was not in the country. So, I can’t kill Mohbad, God sees my heart, and I love him so much. I don’t know anything about his death.”

                    <p>Popular Nigerian music video director, Clarence Peters has been detained by the Lagos State Police Command for questioning over the sudden death of video vixen and choreographer Love Divine, popularly known as Kodak.

                        The spokesperson of the Lagos State Police Command, Bala Elkana while speaking with The Guardian, confirmed that Peters is still in police custody and is “being questioned, along with a few others”. He further stated that the police are “investigating the circumstances around her [Kodak] death”.
                        
                        “It is a full investigation. We are probably looking at murder. We are not concluding at this stage. If she died of electrocution according to reports, it is left for us to find out. Was she actually electrocuted? What went wrong? An autopsy will also show”, Bala said.
                        
                        Peters was said to have been working on an isolated shot with Kodak shortly before her death and others present at his house that day have all been detained by the police.

                    The music star made this known via his Instagram page on Monday, where he expressed his displeasure over plans by the government to borrow money to fund its projects.
                    
                    “Buhari invest in education, it is never too late, start paying students, we need brains to sustain this country’s economy and please stop borrowing money from other countries oooooo. I dey shake ooo,” he wrote.
                    
                    Harrysong’s statement is coming on the heels of the news that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved Nigeria’s $3.4 billion emergency loan request to assist the country to tackle the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
                    
                    The loan, to be repaid within five years, is the largest allocation yet by the IMF to an African country’s bid to contain the pandemic. However, without the loan, Nigeria’s economy could shrink drastically, as the collapse of the price of crude, which makes up more than half of government revenues and 90 per cent of exports, has made it difficult to finance the 2020 budget, according to reports.
                    
                    In addition, the senate had previously accelerated approval to the request by President Muhammadu Buhari to access a fresh loan of N850 billion from the domestic capital market.
