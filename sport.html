                <h2>How son’s death forced Mohammed Usman into UFC</h2>
                <p>Nigeria-born UFC heavyweight champion, Mohammed Usman believes the trauma he suffered outside the cage has prepared him for the challenges that lie ahead in the UFC. Usman’s two-year-old son, Nash, tragically died in a drowning accident in 2019.

                    The UFC heavyweight spoke of his heartbreak during season 30 of The Ultimate Fighter and dedicated his finale victory over Zac Pauga to Nash.
                    
                    “You’ve got to be one with your emotions and instead of masking them just embrace it,” Usman tells BBC Sport.
                    “These emotions inside are like a whirlwind and they are fueling me to compete. I just embrace the emotions, flow with them and let them carry me to the finish line.”
                    
                    His knockout win over Pauga secured a UFC contract and Usman followed that up with a unanimous decision victory against Junior Tafa in April.
                    Usman, who decided to embark on a career in MMA after Nash’s birth in 2016, is now looking focus on the next chapter.
                    
                    “It’s something that happened in my life, and I’m not saying that I’m trying to put it behind me, but you get to a certain point where there are some things you don’t need to keep peeling the wound back,” Usman says.
                    
                    “I don’t just want to keep opening up my scab, I just want to let him [Nash] rest in peace.”

                    <h2>How did boxing go from a global sport for elite competitors to a social media sideshow?</h2>
                    <p>The year is 1900, and the biggest sport in many parts of the western world is boxing. It’s known as the ‘manly art’ in America and ‘pugilism’ in Great Britain. Small towns compete with one another to host more and more shows, giving local boys and men opportunities to fight their way to the top.

                        Europe, Australia, and South America all become areas where fighters begin to tour and put on exhibitions. The world champions of the day are household names, but more than that, boxing itself is a household institution. And then visit 2023… everything is different.
                        
                        The rise of radio, TV, cable and ultimately Pay Per View turned live boxing into something altogether different from a commercial point of view. Yes, the elite fighters of today are rich beyond the wildest dreams of the fighters from 100 years ago, and they have to fight far less to earn their riches too. But all is not as it seems when you ask a boxing fan.
                        
                        They will regale you with stories of how warriors from the past like Benny Lynch and Harry Greb would have had hundreds of fights, fighting multiple times a week in some cases. They took on all comers, fought unlicensed bouts, put on exhibitions in between world title defenses, and always looked to put on a show for the crowd. True, today we have Terence Crawford and Canelo — two fighters who would have excelled in any era — and yet fight fans are dissatisfied. Why is this?
                        
                        In an era in which commercial revenue has never been higher for elite boxing matches, many see there is simply too much to risk by having the best fight the best. This is the era of the undefeated record being worth its weight in gold, of four sanctioning body belts, 17 weight classes and the interim titles fight fans look on with disdain. And yet the boxers make more money than ever before by fighting far less than they would have had to in the past.
                        
                        When Canelo annexed the super middleweight division in just 11 months, he was lauded for fighting three times in less than a year. While this is quite something at a time in boxing when top name fighters rarely fight more....

                <h2>ZUCKERBERG TRAINS WITH ADESANYA AHEAD OF MUSK FIGHT</h2>
                <p>New photos have emerged of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg training with UFC champions Israel Adesanya and Alexander Volkanovski, fueling speculation that he is preparing for a fight with Elon Musk.

                    The photos, which were posted to Instagram by Adesanya, show Zuckerberg working out with the two fighters.
                    
                    The photos have sparked a frenzy of speculation online, with many people wondering if Zuckerberg is serious about fighting Musk. The fight between Zuckerberg and Musk was first proposed by Musk in June, after the two men had a public spat on Twitter. Musk challenged Zuckerberg to a cage match, and Zuckerberg accepted. However, it is unclear if the fight will actually happen.
                    
                    The photos suggest that Zuckerberg may be taking Musk’s challenge seriously. He is seen in the photos looking fit and well-trained, and he is posed with two of the best fighters in the world.
                    
                    It is unclear if Zuckerberg and Musk will actually fight, but the photos have certainly raised the stakes. If the two billionaires do go head-to-head, it would be one of the most anticipated fights in history.</p>

                    <h2>African Warriors Fighting Championshp, Stake sign Sponsorship deal</h2>
                    <p>Nigeria’s biggest promoter of traditional boxing, Dambe, African Warriors Fighting Championship (AWFC), has signed a sponsorship deal with the world’s leading crypto betting outfit, Stake. 

                        According to African Fighting Warriors Championship, the partnership with Stake.com, who also sponsors UFC’s Nigerian champion, is the crypto betting company’s first sponsorship deal in Africa.
                        
                        In the agreement by the two organisations, Stake branding will be integrated into AWFC events through high visibility logo placements on athletes, official uniforms and fight arenas. 
                        
                        
                        The partnership will also offer Stake exposure across AWFC’s digital channels, where it will be visible throughout AWFC’s exciting Dambe contents.
                        
                        AWFC founder, Maxwell Kalu, said the African Warriors Fighting Championship, founded in 2019, is aimed at raising global interest and awareness in Dambe.
                        
                        Kalu said Dambe has built a large international followership and has secured hundreds of millions online views since gaining popularity in Nigeria.
                        
                        He stated that AWFC is also working to raise health and safety standards in Dambe, as it is a non-formalised sport, which has been practised for hundreds of years.
                        
                        Kalu disclosed that AWFC has introduced the first unified rules for Dambe and also pioneered the presence of medical staff at.....

                    <h2>Joshua vs Wilder pushed back to 2024 as Hearn casts doubts on Fury vs Usyk</h2>
                    <p>Eddie Hearn admits that Anthony Joshua vs Deontay Wilder is more likely to hold in January than December – and isn’t expecting Tyson Fury vs Oleksandr Usyk to be on the same card, reports dailymail.co.uk.

                        Saudi promotional outfit, Skills Challenge Entertainment, had initially floated around the idea of a blockbuster show at the back end of the year involving the glamour division’s big four. But that now seems unlikely with Fury set to face former UFC heavyweight champion, Francis Ngannou, on October 28 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
                        
                        
                        A fight between Usyk and Fury would need a suitable promotional campaign and, of course, a period of re-negotiation.
                        
                        So, staging the bout in either December or January doesn’t seem feasible.
                        
                        Hearn acknowledges that the turnaround may be too tight to squeeze the undisputed contest on the same card, but also isn’t convinced Fury wants the fight full stop.
                        
                        “I think it will be January (Joshua vs Wilder), I’m not sure whether Fury vs Usyk gets made (on the same card),” he told Boxing Social. “I don’t expect the Ngannou fight will be so taxing that he can’t fight in January.”

                <h2>New-look PSG in relaxed mood ahead of latest Champions League bid</h2>
                <p>
                    PSG host Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday in their first match in a heavyweight Champions League group which also features AC Milan and Newcastle United.
                    
                    The French title-holders have endured one frustration after another in the competition in recent years, with a defeat by Bayern Munich last season seeing them go out of the Champions League in the last 16 for the fifth time in seven years.
                    
                    Beaten finalists in 2020, PSG went backwards after that, the decision to sign Lionel Messi ultimately backfiring.
                    
                    Messi and Neymar have now left the Parc des Princes after a close-season clear-out which continued up to last week, when Marco Verratti was sold to Qatari side Al-Arabi for a reported 50 million euros ($53.3m).
                    
                    Verratti spent 11 years in Paris and was, at his peak, one of the finest midfielders in the world.
                    
                    But PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi decided it was time to move on and the club accelerated the reconstruction of their squad in recent months, while keeping hold of Kylian Mbappe following a contract dispute that threatened to end his time in the French capital.
                    
                    They spent an estimated 350 million euros on new players, with the biggest outlay coming to sign France forward Randal Kolo Muani from Eintracht Frankfurt for a reported 75 million euros plus bonuses.. ...</p>

                        “Dembele is not yet a PSG player legally, 100 percent no, but 99 percent. There is still one paragraph left in the contract,” card betting the Spaniard told a pre-match press conference in Paris ahead of his team’s Ligue 1 opener against Lorient on Saturday.
                        
                        The 26-year-old Dembele, who was part of France’s 2018 World Cup-winning squad, sports betting is not available to face Lorient at the Parc des Princes.
                        
                        On Tuesday, Barca coach Xavi confirmed the departure of the forward, who would be the French champions’ ninth summer signing, after defenders Milan Skriniar and Lucas Hernandez, midfielders Manuel Ugarte and Cher Ndour, forwards Marco Asensio, Jackpot Lee Kang-in and Goncalo Ramos and goalkeeper Arnau Tenas.

                    <p>Barcelona won La Liga for the first time since 2019 by thrashing Espanyol 4-2 on Sunday, wrestling the title back from rivals Real Madrid.

                        The Catalan giants clinched their 27th Spanish championship at the home of their neighbours, with scenes turning ugly at full time as celebrating Barcelona players were chased from the field by pitch invaders.
                        
                        
                        Robert Lewandowski struck twice for Barcelona, along with goals for Alejandro Balde and Jules Kounde, while Javi Puado and Joselu pulled two back late on for the hosts.
                        
                        Barcelona have endured a troubled period on and off the pitch in recent years but their triumph signals significant improvement, with coach Xavi Hernandez winning his first major trophy since taking over in November 2021.
                        
                        President Joan Laporta’s rebuild was widely criticised last summer in light of the club’s perilous financial situation.

                    <p>Lionel Messi came off the bench and scored as Inter Miami began their push for the Major League Soccer playoffs with a 2-0 win at New York Red Bulls on Saturday.

                        After a week in which Miami won the Leagues Cup and reached the final of the US Open Cup, Messi was left on the bench by coach Gerard “Tata” Martino but came into the game on the hour mark.
                        
                        
                        The Argentine World Cup winner had limited involvement after entering with former Barcelona team-mate Sergio Busquets but made his mark on his regular season debut with an 89th-minute goal.
                        
                        Jordi Alba acrobatically hooked the ball into the box to Messi who twisted and turned then slipped a sublime pass with the outside of his foot to Benjamin Cremaschi whose low first-time cross was tapped in by the seven-times Ballon d’Or winner.
                        
                        Messi has now scored 11 goals in nine appearances in all competitions since joining Inter Miami.
                        
                        “He’s unbelievable, every day it’s something new, on and off the field,” said Miami’s 19-year-old defender Noah Allen.
                        
                        “He’s an amazing person to play with and I am so blessed to play with him.”
                        
                        Martino had indicated that several of his players needed a break after an intense run of eight games within a month and stuck to his word with his team selection, to the disappointment of the capacity crowd at Red Bull Arena.

                    <h2>RONALDO IS TOP PAID ATHLETE; EARNS GWR</h2>
                    <p>Portugal footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has earned himself another Guinness World Record (GWR), as he becomes Forbes Highest paid athlete for the year 2023.


                        The Guinness World Record posted his latest achievement on their official Twitter page, ”
                        It’s another record for Cristiano Ronaldo, as he becomes the world’s highest-paid athlete️⚽️”
                        
                        
                        This is the third time the Al Nassr footballer would be on the Forbes highest-paid athlete list, overtaking the likes of Argentinian footballer Messi and France superstar Kylian Mbappe respectively.
                        
                        Ronaldo takes home a whopping $136 million his closest rival Lionel Messi whom he overtakes, in the 2022 year earns around $ 130 million.
                        
                        While the top three are soccer stars, below is a list of the top ten highest-paid athletes.
                        <h5>
                        Cristiano Ronaldo -$136m
                        Lionel Messi -$130m

                        Kevin Durant -89.1m
                        </h5>
                        
                        How did Forbes calculate its rich list?
                        Forbes collects information about how much money athletes make in a year. This includes the money they earn from winning competitions, their salaries, and any extra bonuses they receive between May 1, 2022, and May 1, 2023. If a sports season ends after May 1, we count the full season’s salary. We also include bonuses from the 2022 NFL season and the 2021-22 NBA season.
                        
                        Apart from on-field earnings, Forbes estimates how much money athletes make off the field. This includes money from sponsorship deals, appearance fees, selling signed items, and licensing income. We also consider any money they make from their own businesses. We don’t count investment income like interest or dividends, but we include the money they receive from selling shares in companies.
                        
                        Forbes doesn’t subtract taxes or fees paid to agents. The list includes all athletes who were active at any point during the 12-month period.
