                <h2>LAOLU NYC, ACTIVELY BLACK UNVEIL EXCITING COLLABORATION AT NEW YORK FASHION WEEK</h2>
                <p>Renowned fashion brand, Laolu NYC, has announced a groundbreaking collaboration with Actively Black.


                    Known for its unique African-inspired designs, Laolu NYC collaboration with the prominent platform promoting diversity and empowerment will showcase the best of colours and style during the highly anticipated New York Fashion Week (NYFW), marking a significant milestone for both brands.
                    
                    The partnership between Laolu NYC and Actively Black represents a powerful fusion of art, culture, and activism. Laolu NYC, led by the visionary artist and designer Laolu Senbanjo, has gained international recognition for its bold and vibrant designs that celebrate African heritage. Actively Black, a leading force in the movement for inclusivity, aims to amplify the voices and stories of Black creatives, entrepreneurs, and change-makers.
                    
                    The collaboration serves as a testament to the importance of representation, inclusivity, and cultural exchange in the fashion world. By merging their creative visions, these two influential brands aim to inspire and empower audiences, while showcasing the immense talent and diversity within the Black community.
                    
                    
                    The collaboration will be unveiled at a special runway show during NYFW, where attendees will have the opportunity to witness the innovative designs and captivating pieces that result from this dynamic partnership. Combining Laolu NYC’s signature aesthetic with Actively Black’s mission of empowerment, the collection promises to be a visual and cultural feast, highlighting the rich tapestry of African heritage and the power of unity.
                    
                    Senbanjo expressed his excitement about the collaboration, stating, “This collaboration is a celebration of our shared commitment to diversity, empowerment, and artistic expression. Through our combined efforts, we aim to create a powerful narrative that challenges stereotypes and inspires positive change.”

                <h2>JEEZY FILES FOR DIVORCE FROM JEANNIE MAI AFTER TWO-YEAR MARRIAGE</h2>
                <p>Rapper Jeezy has filed for divorce from his wife, Jeannie Mai, after two years of marriage.


                    According to the filing, Jeezy, whose real name is Jay Wayne Jenkins, is seeking joint legal custody of the couple’s daughter, Monaco, who was born in January 2022. The couple also has a prenuptial agreement in place, which Jeezy has requested that the court enforce. Jeezy and Mai began dating in 2019 and got married in March 2021. They welcomed their daughter Monaco into the world in January 2022.
                    
                    The couple were married for two and a half years and had a prenuptial agreement. This means that they had a legal agreement in place that outlined how their assets and debts would be divided in the event of a divorce. The document also says that Jeezy wants to share joint legal custody of the couple’s daughter. This means that he wants to have an equal say in making major decisions about her life, such as her education, healthcare, and religion.
                    
                    Jeezy’s filing states that the couple are currently living in a “bona fide state of separation.” This means that they are not living together as husband and wife, and that they have no intention of reconciling.
                    The filing also states that the marriage is “irretrievably broken with no hope for reconciliation.” This is a legal requirement for divorce in many states.
                    
                    In other words, Jeezy is saying that the couple’s marriage is over and that there is no chance of getting back together. He is asking the court to grant him a divorce based on the terms of the prenuptial agreement.
                    
                    Jeezy is a Grammy-nominated rapper who has been in the music industry for over two decades. He has released eight studio albums, including his most recent album, “Snofall,” which was released in 2020.
                    
                    Mai is a television personality who has hosted several talk shows, including “The Real” and “Hollywood Hunter.” She is also a fashion designer and entrepreneur.

                <h2>EMBRACING THE PINK WAVE</h2>
                <p>Doing a double take on a rosy ting in your closet as a guy is a past affair as wearing pink has become even more trendy with the release of 2023 film ‘Barbie’.


                    According to Tony Cook, “Wearing pink automatically tells people you’re a confident character. It’s all about finding the right hues that work with your skin tone.”
                    From sunsets to roses and sparkling summer wines, pink has the remarkable ability to enhance the beauty of various things.
                    
                    “The main worry for guys is that they could look effeminate in pink,” says Mr Porter, contributing style director Dan May. “But no colour is off limits. It’s just the way you style it and the confidence with which you pull it off.” Interestingly, baby boys before the 20th century were dressed in pink, as it was viewed as closer to red and as such a strong colour.
                    
                    It wasn’t until some spurious mid-century neurology was misunderstood to mean that women preferred redder tints. This was furthered sponsored by Barbie’s hot pink paint job on her convertible, while Action Man donned fatigues.

                    In the fashion space while the colour pink has ridden through a battlefield of negativity to attain its current acceptability, we see more designers and men daring the once though feminine colour.
                    
                    Pink can feature in every male piece of clothing and at every occasion. From casual to corporate to sporty and even in accessories: shoes, ties, belts, lapel roses, breast pocket squares, among others. It is important to start small especially when you have not explore the colour before.
                    
                    Here are a few tips to wearing pink
                    * Wear complimentary colours to pink, similar tones or even pastels.
                    * Add a contrasting colour like black, so you don’t look washed out.
                    * Casual street wear is easier to wear with pink, but pink suits can look effective.
                    * Add black or silver accessories to break up all the bright colours.
                    The most important tip is to wear your pink outfit with confidence. Confidence is key to pulling off any outfit. Embrace the boldness of the colour and own it. It is worth remembering that fashion is about expressing yourself. Happy styling!

                    <h2>Youths upskilled in fashion, film, PR, others as Jobberman delivers creative career fair to boost employment</h2>
                    <p>Defying the heavy rains last Saturday, hundreds of Nigerian youths gathered at the 2023 Creative Industry Career Fair organised by Jobberman to learn, network and secure job placements with organisations that exhibited during the Fair.


                        In his opening address, Jobberman Nigeria’s CEO Oreoluwa Boboye said, “We tailored this event to be an all-encompassing approach to addressing the human capital development side of the creative sector. Beyond that, we have also created it as a platform to foster deep and insightful conversations with industry leaders, this is evident in the careful selection of the panellists, niche workshops, and the calibre of speakers we have represented in each.
                        
                        Sam Onyemelukwe, Global Business Development Director, Trace SA, encouraged attendees in his keynote address to constantly seek opportunities to learn as new tools and technologies become available.
                        
                        The Fair featured a Fashion Education Summit led by Sinmi Adesanya from the Council for International African Fashion Education (CIAFE). Participants also had access to upskilling plenaries and workshops, including sessions on film, video and photography; fashion; public relations, communications & marketing, as well as business management and law.
                        
                        
                        “As a learner of Data Analytics at Alx Africa, I learned a lot at the Jobberman Creative Industry Career Fair and won myself a video recording tool that would help me make videos pitching my ideas and innovations. I learnt that I must use a script for my content, document my volunteer experiences and knowing and branding my skills are important,” said Ayodeji Olaiya, a participant at the fair.
                        
                        While panellists in the business management and law session spoke extensively about non-disclosure agreements and how creatives must proactively protect their intellectual property, Grace Alabi, an Instagram and Video marketing strategist, shared other key points she learnt during the other sessions. “I learnt that contracts must have an exit strategy and clause. This will protect you if you eventually discover the terms are not favourable and you want to leave. Also, they shared that as creatives, we have to communicate the value we offer with numbers and data,” she said.
                        
                        Via the complimentary job booths provided to employers at the Fair, organisations held on-the-spot interviews and shared the projects that their companies were working on with Fair attendees. Notable organisations present during the event include M.O.T Lifestyle (motthelabel), Scott’s Legal, Mak Africa, Spurt Africa and AVATA Works Digital Agency. Others were FiberOne Broadband, MNIKS Purple Ventures Ltd and Creative Arts Solution Foundation, amongst many other exhibitors.
                        
                        The Creative Industry Career Fair is part of efforts to help the sector harness its tremendous potential to unlock Nigeria’s economic prospects and provide increased employment opportunities for young people. The event was organised by Jobberman Nigeria through its partnership with the Mastercard Foundation and Obsidian Advisory Africa.</p>

                    <h2>Diversity and inclusion celebrated in Milan with refrain: Make more space for color, curves</h2>
                    <p>MILAN (AP) — More curvy models than ever showed up on Milan runways this season, due mostly to a single show by Brazilian designer Karoline Vitto, while designers of color showcased their work at collateral events meant to promote their visibility in the backrooms of Italian fashion.

                        Wherever diversity and inclusion were being celebrated during Milan Fashion Week, which ended Sunday, there was one underlying refrain: Make more space.<h2>CURVY MODELS GET OUTING AT KAROLINE VITTO</h2>
                        “We made history! It was incredible,’’ world-renown curvy model Ashley Graham gushed as she embraced London-based Vitto after Sunday’s show.Plus-size models like Graham, Precious Lee and Paloma Elsesser are often the only curvy models on fashion runways for any given show, but for Vitto’s preview Graham led an entire cast of models ranging in size from UK 10 to UK 24 (US 6 to US 20).

                        Vogue Business reported in March that just .06% of 9,137 Fall-Winter 2023-24 looks across 219 shows in four fashion cities featured models over size US 14, underlying the lack of size diversity.
                        
                        By comparison, some Milan brands typically size up to 48 Italian (US size 12), while some, notably Dolce & Gabbana which sponsored Vitto, has extended some looks up to an Italian size 52 (US 16).
                        
                        Graham wore an edgy black ripped corset and long sheer skirt, while other models wore form-hugging jersey dresses fitted with S-shaped metallic fixtures that sculpted their curves. She used the same technique for bathing suits.“It feels normal,’’ Graham said, calling on more designers to get more curves on the runway. “If I feel normal on the runway with this many girls, that means that there is something that doesn’t feel normal when I am on the runway with everybody else.”

                        __
                       <h2> SHOWCASING SMALL POC BRANDS</h2>
                        After working in fashion for decades, Deborah Latouche launched her own brand after converting to Islam and realizing how hard it was to find clothes that were “luxury, high-end and modest.”
                        
                        Latouche brand, Sabirah, was highlighted along with US brand BruceGlen at the Milan Fashion Hub for new and emerging designers, sponsored by Blanc Magazine’s Teneshia Carr and the Italian National Fashion Chamber. The Hub offered space to meet buyers and other people interested in new brands.</p>

                    <h2>Dior triumphs melding women’s past and future, while Saint Laurent puts on study in power dressing</h2>
                    <p>PARIS (AP) — Amid the electric ambiance of strobe lights and an usually sweltering Parisian fall, Dior’s show Tuesday set in the Tuileries gardens witnessed a dazzling circus of stars. With Hollywood’s recent writers’ strike still on, insiders mused if Paris Fashion Week would be the season’s celebrity magnet – and the presence of Jennifer Lawrence, Charlize Theron, Elizabeth Debicki, and Kim Jisoo seemed to echo that sentiment.

                        But the real star this season was the collection itself. Never one to shy away from a statement on feminism, the Italian couturier Maria Grazia Chiuri crafted an unusually subtle collection in predominantly black and white that fused echoes of the medieval and contemporary. Set against an art backdrop challenging time-worn perceptions on women’s roles, this show was not only a reminder that fashion is a mirror of society – but among her most accomplished so far.
                        
                        Here are some highlights of spring-summer 2024 ready-to-wear shows in Paris, including Saint Laurent’s starry study in power dressing.The atmosphere was charged with palpable anticipation. But even more electric was Chiuri’s dance between the medieval and the 80s punk – the former, an era of chivalry and legends, the latter, an age of defiant self-expression.

                        The first looks to grace the runway were what might be called “gamine gothic.” The garments, draped in a play of black with cascading tassels, bore dynamic clumps of silk that crafted a silhouette both historic and undeniably fresh. But fashion, much like history, is cyclical, and soon this dark romanticism gave way to stark white interpretations. The result? A nod to the rebellious 80s, evoking memories of punk rockers and their spirited defiance.
                        
                        But Chiuri didn’t stop at mere clothing. The accessories — from contemporary neck chokers to sometimes-bejeweled leg bands that one might associate with armor — added layers of intrigue. And just when insiders thought that they’d seen the collection’s pièce de resistance, Chiuri surprised with an audacious take: a medieval-inspired bikini in stark black.
                        
                        While the designs borrowed elements from historical eras, they also encapsulated the spirit and journey of the contemporary woman. The ash and chamomile tones, paired with the evocative use of fabrics, served as metaphors for strength, defiance, and progression.One gown, with its black medieval lace motif adorning the bust, bore an uncanny resemblance to the head of a charging bull, symbolizing, perhaps, the undying spirit and tenacity of the women Chiuri designs for.

                        While the couturier’s previous efforts to infuse designs with feminist commentary have sometimes seemed forced, this season finally towed the line between message and subtlety.<h2>DIOR’S FEMINIST FORAY: CHIURI’S RUNWAY SHINES IN TUILERIES GARDENS</h2>Chiuri is steadily gaining renown as perhaps the most politically engaged designer heading up a European fashion powerhouse. In an industry fixated on fleeting aesthetics, Chiuri’s emphasis on deep-rooted feminist activism sets her apart. Tuesday’s show stands as testimony to this.

                        Chiuri often fuses art with fashion through collaborations with avant-garde artists. Tuesday saw the dynamic Elena Bellantoni taking center stage. Together, the duo unveiled a monumental video installation at the Tuileries Gardens, turning the annex into a glowing canvas of feminist fervor. Towering 7-meter-high LED screens pulsed with vivid yellows and fuchsias, reminiscent of highlighters underscoring vital messages – and used by secretaries the world over. Iconography and cheeky slogans, notably the audacious “Your secretary knows how to do it better,” provoked thought while inciting VIPs to capture the moment.</p>

                    <p>In the ever-evolving world of fashion, trends tend to make a comeback when we least expect it. As we delve into the heart of the 21st century, it seems that history is repeating itself in the most stylish of ways.


                        This season, we’re witnessing a revival of some classic wardrobe staples that have been given a fresh, contemporary twist.
                        
                        From the wide-legged elegance of palazzo trousers to the comfort and versatility of leggings, the breeziness of shorts, and the liberation of free tops, these timeless pieces are back with a vengeance.
                        
                        Palazzo Trousers: A Flare for the Dramatic
                        Palazzo trousers, known for their wide and flowing legs, have been a symbol of elegance and grace since the 1960s. Today, they are back in the limelight, making a bold statement on runways and streets alike. Designers are experimenting with various fabrics, patterns, and lengths, ensuring there’s a palazzo style for every fashion enthusiast.
                        
                        What makes palazzo trousers so appealing is their versatility. Pair them with a fitted top for a sleek and sophisticated look, or choose a tucked-in blouse for a bohemian vibe. These trousers can effortlessly transition from day to night, making them a must-have addition to your wardrobe this season.
                        
                        Leggings: Comfort Meets Style
                        Leggings, once relegated to workout wear, have now become a fashion statement in their own right. The resurgence of leggings in everyday fashion can be attributed to their comfort and versatility. The fashion world has taken notice, and designers are incorporating leggings into a wide range of outfits.
                        
                        For a casual daytime look, throw on a loose-fitting tunic or a tailored blazer to elevate your leggings. To make a bold fashion statement, experiment with textures, patterns, and even leather or faux leather leggings for a chic, edgy vibe. With the right pair of shoes and accessories, leggings can take you from brunch to the boardroom with ease.
                        
                        Shorts: Embracing the Breeze
Shorts are synonymous with summer, but in recent years, they’ve taken on a more prominent role in year-round fashion. From tailored Bermuda shorts for a polished look to sporty and casual styles, shorts are proving their versatility in any season.

For a sophisticated spin, choose high-waisted shorts paired with a crisp blouse and statement belt. To capture a more casual, off-duty look, denim or linen shorts paired with a graphic tee or a free-flowing top can do wonders. As we’ve witnessed on the runways, shorts are no longer just a warm-weather staple – they’re a year-round fashion essential.

Free Tops: Embracing Unrestricted Style
The resurgence of free tops reflects the current cultural shift towards comfort and self-expression. These tops, characterised by their loose, flowing silhouettes and often oversized designs, provide an opportunity for individuals to embrace their unique style and break free from conventional fashion norms.

From oversized sweaters to billowing blouses, free tops can be effortlessly paired with a variety of bottoms, from jeans to leggings and even skirts. Accessorise with chunky jewellery or a statement belt to add a touch of personality to your ensemble. The free top movement is all about embracing individuality and celebrating comfort without sacrificing style.

All in all, fashion trends may come and go, but the classics always find their way back into our hearts and closets. This season’s comeback of palazzo trousers, leggings, shorts, and free tops is a testament to the timelessness of these wardrobe staples.

So, whether you’re seeking comfort, style, or a bit of both, don’t hesitate to embrace these versatile and timeless pieces as they make their triumphant return to the fashion spotlight. Remember, fashion is about expressing yourself, and these trends provide the perfect canvas for your unique style.</p>

                <p>MILAN (AP) — The Milan fashion world has become a designer carousel. Powerhouse Gucci and Swiss luxury brand Bally both introduced designers this season, while Tod’s bade their creative director farewell and Moschino is in an interim phase.

                    The question on everyone’s minds: Where will former Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele, who has been out of circulation since stepping down last November, next pop up? Rumors are flying.
